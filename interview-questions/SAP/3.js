/**
 *
Design library management system
Requirements:

1. Any library member should be able to search books by their title, author, subject.

2. Each book will have a unique identification number and other details including a
rack number which will help to physically locate the book.

3. There could be more than one copy of a book, and library members should be able
to check-out and reserve any copy.

We will call each copy of a book, a book item.
4. The system should be able to retrieve information like who took a particular book
or what are the books checked-out
by a specific library member.

5. The system should be able to collect fines for books returned after the due date.

6. Members should be able to reserve books that are not currently available.
